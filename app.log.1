It's natural to feel scared, depressed, and blocked when going through a major transition like this. It's important to give yourself time to grieve, process your emotions, and seek support during this difficult time.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that might help you navigate this difficult period:\n\n1. **Seek Support**: Consider reaching out to friends, family members, or a therapist to talk about your feelings and get emotional support. Talking to someone can help you feel less alone and provide perspective on your situation.\n\n2. **Take Care of Yourself**: Remember to prioritize self-care. Try to maintain a routine, eat well, exercise, and get enough rest. Engaging in activities you enjoy can also help lift your spirits.\n\n3. **Set Small Goals**: Break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Setting small goals and achieving them can help build your confidence and motivation to move forward.\n\n4. **Explore New Interests**: This could be a great time to rediscover old hobbies or explore new interests. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment can help in the healing process.\n\n5. **Consider Professional Help**: If you find yourself struggling to cope with your emotions, don't hesitate to seek professional help. A therapist or counselor can provide you with tools to manage your feelings and navigate this challenging time.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel the way you do, and it's important to take things one step at a time. You're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to support you through this difficult period. If you ever need someone to talk to or if there's anything specific you'd like advice on, feel free to share."}
