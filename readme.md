My Project: Lenox
A personal assistant and trading companion named 'Lenox'. 
Lenox, we'll focus on integrating advanced features and technologies and libraries. This includes deploying more sophisticated natural language processing techniques for a deeper understanding of user queries, enhancing the system's ability to conduct dynamic and real-time market analysis, personalizing user experience.

 Lenox's Role: Lenox is intended to be a e crypto insights, analyzing news and prices, and discussing live trading opportunities.
the Lenox project, which aims to leverage AI for real-time analysis and advice on cryptocurrency trading. Lenox's mission is to digest live data from diverse sources, including market trends, news updates, and social media insights, to provide actionable trading recommendations.
These advancements will transform Lenox into a more intelligent, responsive, and user-centric AI assistant, capable of providing highly personalized and accurate cryptocurrency insights and analysis.

Architecture:
* main.py: This is the main file that uses Flask, a Python web framework, to create a web application. This application uses Panel, a library for creating interactive dashboards, to display live crypto insights and conversations with an AI. The AI part seems to be powered by OpenAI's API, and it interacts with the user through a text input. The application can also clear chat history and handle user queries about the crypto market.
* tool.py: This file defines tools for getting cryptocurrency data and news. It uses external APIs to fetch the current price of a specified cryptocurrency and the latest news related to cryptocurrencies. These tools are decorated with a custom decorator, indicating they can be integrated with the main application for specific functionalities, such as fetching data or news based on user queries.
* utils.py: Although the content was truncated, it appears this file contains utilities for integrating the tools defined in tool.py with the conversational AI in main.py. It likely includes functions for formatting the tool outputs to be compatible with OpenAI's API, managing conversation history, and parsing the AI's output to display relevant information based on user queries.
       
In simple words, the script works like this:
* The web application (main.py) allows users to interact with it through a web interface, asking questions or requesting information about cryptocurrencies.
* When a user enters a query, the application uses the defined tools (in tool.py) to fetch real-time data or news about cryptocurrencies.
* The AI component (powered by OpenAI's API) processes these queries to provide conversational insights, integrating live data fetched by the tools.
* The utils.py file supports this process by ensuring the data fetched by the tools is correctly formatted and integrated into the AI's responses, and by managing the conversation's flow and history.
      
The mechanism behind the scenes involves fetching data from external sources (like crypto prices and news), processing user queries with AI to generate insights, and presenting these insights through an interactive web  dashboard.

# LangChain Toolset Documentation

## Overview

This Python code defines a set of tools utilizing different APIs for various purposes in the crypto market. The tools are designed to be used within a conversational agent framework to provide responses based on user queries.

#

## Usage

The tools can be imported and used individually in your Python scripts or integrated into a larger conversational agent framework. The `ConversationBufferMemory` class and other utility functions are used to store and manage conversation history.
